# Lethal Company: Vanilla Enhanced & Extended (VR Edition) #

Lethal Company taken to the next level featuring new enemies, moons, dungeons and items. Pre-configured for the best experience with lore friendly and seamless integration.

This modpack aims to be an extension of vanilla content and intends to provide a cohesive experience. It additionally prioritizes compatibility and aims to minimize issues while playing.

The VR version is stripped down in functionality and places a focus on VR compatibility. It contains less mods but has been curated to still be a great playable experience.

Base game content is mostly preserved with only improvements to the core gameplay. New dungeons and other new content is locked behind custom moons to keep replay-ability high while other changes are kept to low spawn chances to provide new and fun encounters in the base game.
