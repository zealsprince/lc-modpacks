# Lethal Company: Vanilla Enhanced & Extended #

Lethal Company taken to the next level featuring new enemies, moons, dungeons and items. Pre-configured for the best experience with lore friendly and seamless integration.

This modpack aims to be an extension of vanilla content and intends to provide a cohesive experience. It additionally prioritizes compatibility and aims to minimize issues while playing.

Base game content is mostly preserved with only improvements to the core gameplay. New dungeons and other new content is locked behind custom moons to keep replay-ability high while other changes are kept to low spawn chances to provide new and fun encounters in the base game.
